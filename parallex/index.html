            <h2>Adventure Time!</h2>
            <p>Adventure Time is one of the most popular shows on Cartoon Network. The show follows the adventures of
                Finn and Jake, two friends who are always trying to save the day. The show is full of action and
                adventure, and it is sure to keep you entertained from beginning to end.

                One of the most exciting aspects of Adventure Time is its complex plot. The show is full of twists and
                turns that will keep you guessing all the way through. Whether you are a fan of mystery stories or just
                looking for an exciting adventure, Adventure Time is sure to satisfy your needs.</p>

                </div>

            <p>Biking is a top-notch cardio workout. You’ll burn about 400 calories an hour. Plus it strengthens your
                lower body, including your legs, hips, and glutes.

                If you want a workout that’s gentle on your back, hips, knees, and ankles, this is a great choice.

                You can cycle on the road, a bike path, or a mountain trail. Indoors, you can do your workout on a
                stationary bike or buy a stand, called an indoor trainer, for your outdoor bike.

                If you’re a beginner, choose a flat bike path or road. If you’re ready for a tougher workout that also
                engages your upper body and core, try mountain biking. It’s also called off-road biking. You can do it
                on trails and different types of rough terrain.</p>

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paragliders: lightweight,
                free-flying, foot-launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure.[1] The pilot sits in a
                harness or in a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended below a fabric wing. Wing shape is maintained by the
                suspension lines, the pressure of air entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic
                forces of the air flowing over the outside.

                Despite not using an engine, paraglider flights can last many hours and cover many hundreds of
                kilometres, though flights of one to five hours and covering some tens of kilometres are more the norm.
                By skillful exploitation of sources of lift, the pilot may gain height, often climbing to altitudes of a
                few thousand metres</p>

                    <p>Surfing</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Surfing’s roots lie in premodern Hawaii and Polynesia, where the sport was practiced by both men and
                women from all social strata from royalty to commoners. Early European explorers and travelers praised
                the skills of Hawaiian surfers, but 19th-century missionaries assigned to the islands disapproved of the
                “constant intermingling, without any restraint, of persons of both sexes” and banned the pastime.
                Surfing was practiced only sporadically in Hawaii by the end of the 19th century.</p>
